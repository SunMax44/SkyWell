Data Resolution and Interpolation Issues
=====================================

1. CAMS Data Resolution
----------------------
- Air Quality Data: 0.1° × 0.1° resolution (10×10 grid for Berlin)
  * Contains: PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, pollen data
  * Status: Usable but needs interpolation to target resolution

- Atmospheric Composition Data: 0.4° × 0.4° resolution (3×3 grid for Berlin)
  * Contains: UV data
  * Status: Too coarse for Berlin (3×3 cells), needs alternative source

2. Target Resolution
-------------------
- Current target: 0.01° × 0.01° (72×101 grid for Berlin)
- Issue: Large upscaling from 10×10 to 72×101 might cause interpolation artifacts

Next Steps
==========

1. UV Data
----------
- Find alternative data source for UV with better resolution
- Consider sources:
  * Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) UV index
  * ECMWF UV forecast data
  * Local weather station data
  * Satellite-based UV measurements

2. Interpolation Code Review
---------------------------
- Review grid.py interpolation logic
- Check for potential issues:
  * How are we handling the large upscaling (10×10 to 72×101)?
  * Are we using appropriate interpolation methods?
  * Are we properly handling the time dimension?
  * Are we correctly mapping the coordinates?

3. Data Quality
--------------
- Add validation steps to ensure interpolated data makes sense
- Compare interpolated values with original data
- Add checks for unreasonable values or interpolation artifacts

4. Documentation
---------------
- Document the resolution of each data source
- Document the interpolation methods used
- Add warnings about data quality limitations

Note: These issues need to be addressed before proceeding with the risk calculation implementation.
